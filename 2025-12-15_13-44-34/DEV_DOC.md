# 1. Environment Setup From Scratch

## Prerequisites

### Install the following on the host machine:

Docker

Docker Compose

A .env file located at:
```
$(HOME)/env/.env
```
Required .env variables

**MariaDB**

DB_NAME  
DB_USER  
DB_PASSWORD  
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD

**WordPress**

WP_ADMIN_USER  
WP_ADMIN_PASSWORD  
WP_ADMIN_EMAIL

**Domain**

DOMAIN_NAME=pauldos-.42.fr

# 2. Building and Launching the Project
Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repo-url> rootInception
cd rootInception
```
Build and start everything:
```
make
```
Or explicitly:
```
make all
```
This will:  
	+ Build all service images from the included Dockerfiles
	+ Create persistent data folders
	+ Start the full Docker Compose stack

```
make up
```
This will:  
	+ Build all service images from the included Dockerfiles
	
# 3. Useful Commands for Developers
View running containers:
```
docker compose ps
```
View logs:
```
docker logs nginx
docker logs wordpress
docker logs mariadb
```
Rebuild everything:
```
make re
```
Stop containers:
```
make down
```
Stop and clean orphan containers and removes volumes at the Docker:
```
make clean
```
Full cleanup (containers, images, volumes, mariadb and wordpress host data folders, .env):
```
make fclean
```
Enter service shells:
```
docker exec -it wordpress bash
docker exec -it mariadb bash
```
# 4. Data Persistence and Storage Layout

The project uses Docker volumes mapped to user directories:
```
$(HOME)/data/mariadb/
$(HOME)/data/wordpress/
```

mariadb/ stores all database tables

wordpress/ stores uploads, plugins, themes, and persistent WordPress content

Previously saved info is not removed unless running:
```
make fclean
```

```
Each service is built from scratch, using its own Dockerfile, config files, and entrypoint scripts.

# 6. Development Notes and Design Decisions

+ No prebuilt images (mandatory requirement)
+ A private Docker network isolates services internally
+ NGINX enforces HTTPS using self-signed certificates
+ WordPress is executed through PHP-FPM for performance
+ MariaDB is initialized using custom scripts
+ The Makefile automates the full workflow: setup, rebuild, cleanup
